# Privacy Policy — Below The Surface
**Last Updated:** 15 November 2025

## Overview
**Below The Surface** aims to collect as little data as possible.  
At this time, the game collects **no personal information** and does **not** require user accounts.

The game is built with **Kaboom.js**, a JavaScript game engine.  
Kaboom.js does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

We may integrate optional third-party services such as **Firebase** (e.g., Analytics or Crashlytics) to improve stability and understand app performance. Details are below.

---

## 1. Information We May Collect (Firebase)
If Firebase services are enabled, they may automatically collect:

- Device information (model, OS version)
- Anonymous app usage data (screens, crashes, performance)
- Installation identifiers
- Crash logs (non-personal)

This information is **anonymous** and **cannot identify you personally**.

### Opting Out
Android users may opt out of analytics collection through the device’s system settings (“Opt out of Ads Personalization” or “Usage & Diagnostics”).

---

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect
We do **not** collect:

- Name, email, phone number, or any personal identifiers  
- Location data  
- Contact list  
- Photos, media, or files  
- Payment information  
- IP address tracking for identification  
- Custom user profiles  

No gameplay data is tied to any user identity.

## 3. Third-Party Services
The app may use:

### **Firebase (Google LLC)**
Purposes:
- Crash reporting  
- Anonymous usage analytics  

Firebase data is governed by Google's privacy policy:  
https://policies.google.com/privacy

### **Kaboom.js**
Kaboom is a client-side game framework.  
It does **not** collect or transmit any data.

The game does **not** integrate ads, ad networks, or marketing SDKs.

---

## 4. Permissions
The app does **not** request any dangerous or sensitive permissions.  

---

## 5. Data Storage
All gameplay state exists only in memory.  
If Firebase is used, analytics and crash logs are stored on Google servers in aggregated form.

Uninstalling the app removes all local data.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy
The game does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.  
If anonymous Firebase data is collected, it remains non-identifiable.

---

## 7. Security
All communications with Firebase (if enabled) are encrypted via HTTPS.  
We do not store any personal information.
